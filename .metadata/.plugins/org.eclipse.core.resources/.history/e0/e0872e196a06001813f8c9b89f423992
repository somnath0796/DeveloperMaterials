If data as objects has to be transfered from one heap to another heap over a network(Distributed Computing).
They cannot be read as Objects. Hence has to be changed to Stream data.
Hence it is called Serialized. Hence we use RMI(Remote Method Invocation) to make it work.
We use Marker Interfaces to implements such objects where there state and class metadata to be captured at runtime. 
They are made to be Serializable. Hence class must implement Serializable Interface.
